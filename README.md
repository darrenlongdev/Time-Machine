Game Theory Strategic Clock

Manually input the date and time that you wish to start counting from using the numbers on your computer
keyboard.

Once all 14 digits have been entered press the Enter key. This will now lock in the date and time to the red
row (top row). Press enter again to start the clock.

The green row (middle row) will begin to count.

The yellow row (bottom row) will display the actual date and time when the clock began to count.

To change speed settings or pause time, open the File menu and select the appropriate setting. The currently
selected setting will have a tick next to it to indicate it’s selected. Time settings are as follows:
1 second = 1 second(real time)
3 minutes = 1 day
10 seconds = 1 day

USA formatted version and customisations can be made for a consultancy fee.
